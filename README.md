# Pedal Icons

Repository of useful graphics for designing guitar pedal decals.

Gallery: https://warmans.github.io/pedal-decals/gallery/index.html

## Converting SVGs to PNGs

Run `make convert.pngs` to generate PNG versions of all the SVGs (saved to `gen/png`).

Coneversion requires `rsvg-convert` binary which is found in `librsvg2-bin` in the Ubuntu package manager.

## Contributing

For consistency please contribute icons with the following properties: 

- Image shoud use a canvas size of 1024x1024 and the longest side of the icon should be 1024px.
- Images should default to black on white where other colours are not needed for the specific graphic.
